# Job Scheduling Algorithms Simulation

This repository contains implementations of algorithms to solve the Job Scheduling Problem using Greedy, Dynamic Programming, and Brute Force approaches. The Job Scheduling Problem is a fundamental problem in computer science, often related to optimizing resource usage and minimizing costs.

This project was completed for my course CSE373: Design and Analysis of Algorithms.
